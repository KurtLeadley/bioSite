                    This is mostly place holder text, but my grandfather has done a lot in his life. He grew up in the city, 
                    but soon found himself living up in the Adirondacks, in New York! He has been a superintendent of a school,
                    quite a hunter, a father, a husband, a grandfather and also managed to build a house by himself,
                    While living in it! More to come soon!....
